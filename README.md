Setup environments

Using scripts from console
The template already has scripts to execute the project calling a specific environment defined into the package.json file. Keep in mind that if you are going to create new envs you have to define the script to build the project properly.

To define which env you want to use, just keep the structure yarn [platform]: [environment]

DEV: yarn ios or yarn android
